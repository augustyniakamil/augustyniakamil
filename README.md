### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### About me
Programming is my passion, in particular web development. For almost 2 years Iâ€™ve worked as a Front-end Developer in Software House in Olsztyn (Poland). I work with big business applications where we use the Angular framework. 

My adventure with Angular started from the 4th version and I really like it. Reactive programming by using RxJS is not unfamiliar to me. And what about React?! Unfortunately, I donâ€™t have any commercial experience with it but I donâ€™t say NO.  Contrary! Iâ€™d like to try it. Iâ€™m on the Typescript and clean code side so I often like fixing something and making it better. 

I try to develop my skills and knowledge of JavaScript and everything that is connected with it. It gives me a bigger perspective on the whole process of web application development. Every solved problem and newly learned things make me stronger! Checking myself during new challenges brings me a lot of satisfaction. In my free time, I like watching a good movie or TV show (Iâ€™m a Marvelâ€™s fan).
